### Pointers

* Concurrency
* Automatic memory management
* Compiled language, so it is faster than dynamically typed languages
* Balances expressiveness with safety
* Simpler type system
* Lighter threads called go routines
* Go require less storage and less allocations with aggregate types like structs and arrays

* Standard library has clean building blocks
* What bitly says
  We like tools that are efficient and powerful. We like to avoid the unnecessarily complex. We like repeatable patterns, open source, clear standards and high performance. We like easy-to-read code because we like easy-to-maintain code. This is why we like Go.


* It has comparatively few features and is unlikely to add more. 

For instance, it has no implicit numeric conversions, no constructors or destructor s, no operator overloading, no default parameter values, no inheritance, no generics, no exceptions, no macros, no function annotations, and no thread-local storage. 

The language is mature and stable, and guarantees backwards compatibilitsy: older Go programs can be compiled and run with newer versions of compi lers and stand ard librar ies.

### Garbage Collector:-
- Memory Safety
- High run time speed (fast and efficient)
- Resource efficiency

Go has simple interface and low level capabilities of C, C++

"The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google, and thereby to make the process more productive and scalable. The language was designed by and for people who write. read and debug and maintain large software systems.” — Rob Pike, creator of Golang


That’s being said, Go was designed while having a set of particular problems to solve and initially possessing a solid base of the best features from such noble programming languages as C, Pascal, Modula, and Oberon. It also kept in mind useful characteristics of languages — Python, C++, Java, and so on — criticism of which Go was meant to address.


..
Also, at this point, it becomes clear that Go is, in fact, unlike other languages, since they are evolving commonly by adding new features, thereafter growing their complexity and becoming convergent. Whereas Go uses an approach to constrain itself in the first place and then stays mostly finite from its very beginning.

“Many newcomers to Go ask for features from languages they know. But those features do not belong in Go — and the language is fixed. Adding features to Go would not make it better, just bigger. That would make Go less interesting by being less different.” — Rob Pike, creator of Golang
